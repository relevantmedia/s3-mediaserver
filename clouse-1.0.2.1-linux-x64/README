1. INSTALLATION

To install ClouSE run the install-clouse script as root.  Make sure that
the MySQL server is running and be prepared to enter the password for the
MySQL root user.  For information about install-clouse options run

shell> ./install-clouse --help

To configure Cloud Storage Connection, the script is going to prompt for
three pieces of information: Access Key, Secret Key, and Bucket URL.

The Access Key and Secret Key can be retrieved here:

* Amazon S3             https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/securityCredentials
* Google Cloud Storage  https://code.google.com/apis/console

The Bucket URL has the following format:

* Amazon S3             s3://s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket>/<prefix>
* Google Cloud Storage  gs://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/<bucket>/<prefix>

The <bucket> is the name of the bucket that is going to store the database
data.  A bucket can be created (or you can find an existing bucket) here:

* Amazon S3             https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home
* Google Cloud Storage  https://storage.cloud.google.com

The <prefix> is just an arbitrary name that can be used to isolate your
database data from other files in the bucket.

If installation fails, please refer to the "Troubleshooting Configuration
and Connection Issues" section in clouse.pdf, or go to
http://www.oblaksoft.com/documentation/troubleshooting/ for potential
solutions.


2. USING CLOUSE

To create a table in ClouSE the ENGINE=CLOUSE option can be used in
the CREATE TABLE statement, for example:

mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (id INT KEY, data VARCHAR(64)) ENGINE=CLOUSE;

Alternatively, the default-storage-engine configuration option can
be set to ClouSE so that all new tables are created in ClouSE by
default (the my-clouse.cnf file has this option set to ClouSE).

To move an existing table to ClouSE the ENGINE=CLOUSE option can be
used in the ALTER TABLE statement, for example:

mysql> ALTER TABLE t2 ENGINE=CLOUSE;
